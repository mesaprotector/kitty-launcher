#Kitty Launcher config file. Work in progress. For now it only controls the available commands
#but more functionality will be added.

#Applications

#The format is: ARGUMENT;;COMMAND;NUMBER (number defaults to âˆž if not present).
#For now, if one argument ENDS with another as a substring (example: rm and hdparm) the shorter
#one must be first, or it will run the wrong command.
#Examples:
#firefox;;firefox;0
#praat;;GTK_THEME=Breeze boxxy praat;1
